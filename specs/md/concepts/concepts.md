# Concepts

Entities that represent what a resource is about.

In Linked Art, Concept entities are represented by the `Type` class. Concept entities should be generated for subject headings and classification numbers in MARC.

-   **[Subject headings](../concepts/subject_headings.md)**  
Resources extracted from MARC 6XX entries.
-   **[Classification numbers](../concepts/classification_numbers.md)**  


**Parent topic:**[Related entities](../concepts/related_entities.md)
