# Concepts

In Linked Art, Concept entities are represented by the `Type` class. Concept entities should be generated for classification numbers and subject headings in MARC.

For each Concept entity, an embedded reference should be added within the "record-level" resource \(Textual Work, Visual Work, or Digital Object\).

**Parent topic:**[Related entities](../concepts/related_entities.md)
