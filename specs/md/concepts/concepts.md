# Concepts

Entities that represent what a resource is about.

In Linked Art, concept entities are represented by the `Type` class. Concept entities should be generated for subject headings and classification numbers in MARC.

-   **[Classification numbers](../tasks/concepts/classification_numbers.md)**  
Resources extracted from MARC 050 and 090 entries.
-   **[Subject and genre/form headings](../tasks/concepts/subject_headings.md)**  
Resources extracted from MARC 6XX entries.
-   **[Roles \[draft\]](../tasks/concepts/roles.md)**  
Roles for related entities.

**Parent topic:**[Related entities](../tasks/related_entities.md)
