# Groups

Entities that represent groups of people functioning collectively \(e.g., organizations and meetings/conferences\).

Group entities are represented by the `Group` class.

Group entities may function either in creator/contributor \(agent\) roles or within subject/concept structures.

For Group entities that are part of name-title entries in MARC, see [Groups with works](../tasks/name-title/groups_with_works.md).

-   **[Top-level group entities](../concepts/top_level_group_entities.md)**  
Group entities extracted from both subject \(6XX\) and agent \(11X and 71X\) fields.
