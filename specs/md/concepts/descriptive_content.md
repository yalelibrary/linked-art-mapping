# Descriptive content

Content that represents attributes of an entity \(for example: identifiers, notes, publication information\).

Descriptive content may include references to top-level entities, but typically stores variable `content` values \(string literals\) with `classified_as` relationships pointing to concepts in a taxonomy or controlled vocabulary.

1.  [Identifiers](../concepts/identifiers.md)  
Standard alphanumeric values used to uniquely identify a resource.
2.  [Titles](../concepts/titles.md)  
Names supplied for record-level resources.
