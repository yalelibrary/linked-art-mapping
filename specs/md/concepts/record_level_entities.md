# Record-level entities

Entities that correspond to resources held by the library \(books, journals, databases, archival collections, etc.\).

The base class for record-level entities is determined by the supertype mapping. When a record-level entity is mapped to more than one supertype format, and the formats have different base classes, the following order of priority is applied:

1.  `Set`

2.  `LinguisticObject`

3.  `VisualItem`

4.  `DigitalObject`

5.  `HumanMadeObject`
