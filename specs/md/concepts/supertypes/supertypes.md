# LUX supertype taxonomy

The Linked Art profile of the [CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model \(CRM\)](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/html/5.0.4/cidoc-crm.html) includes a limited number of core classes; these can be refined by referencing terms from a taxonomy or classification scheme. Because record-level entities can be of many types, a *supertype* scheme has been developed for use in LUX.

The LUX supertype scheme is divided into two levels: *types* and *formats*. Types represent the mode of expression of a resource \(textual, visual, audible, etc.\), whereas formats can be thought of as specific instances of a type: for example, a *book* is an instance or format of *textual work*. Some formats, such as *Geospatial Data* are instances of two different types: *Datasets* and *Cartography*.

MARC-to-Linked Art supertype mappings are done at the level of the most specific format, with type and broader format relations inferred from the hierarchy.
