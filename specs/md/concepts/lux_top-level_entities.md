# LUX top-level entities

Eleven top-level entities are required for use in LUX.

In LUX, top-level entities can be divided into *record-level* entities, which correspond to resources held by the library \(books, journals, databases, archival collections, etc.\), and *related* entities, which correspond to the people, places, concepts, etc., connected to those resources in some way.

In Linked Art, record-level entities are further divided into two categories:

-   Conceptual entities, which represent the intellectual content of a resource

-   Physical objects, which carry that content in a tangible form


Digital objects are a special case because they can function as either conceptual entities or content carriers, depending on the context.

1.  [Record-level entities](../concepts/record_level_entities.md)  
Entities that correspond to resources held by the library \(books, journals, databases, archival collections, etc.\).
2.  [Work-level entities \[draft\]](../concepts/work_level_entities.md)  

3.  [Related entities](../tasks/related_entities.md)  
Entities that represent the people, places, concepts, etc., that are connected to record-level resources.
