# ldac {#ldac .concept}

Forum showcasing different perspectives on Wikidata in libraries, with the goal of discussing the perceived benefits or disadvantages of working with Wikidata in library cataloging workflows.

In August 2020, the Program for Cooperative Cataloging \(PCC\) launched a new pilot project to engage with the Wikidata platform and community. Over 70 institutions \(including PCC members and nonmembers\) have volunteered to participate in the effort. The projects proposed by participating institutions represent a range of interests and priorities. Join us for a conversation with information professionals whose experience can help the library community reflect on what it means to engage with Wikidata--as a structured data platform and as a community of practice.

Our panelists are:

-   Peggy Griesinger, Head of Metadata Initiatives at Notre Dame
-   Darnelle Melvin, Special Collections and Archives Metadata Librarian at the University of Nevada Las Vegas
-   Rob Sanderson, Director for Cultural Heritage Metadata at Yale University
-   Meg Wacha, Scholarly Communications Librarian at CUNY and president of Wikimedia NYC
